        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Gerard Degas and I am a web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in a household with a French father and learned to speak French and think in other languages
          at a very young age. Since then I developed a love for learning languages and have since also learned
          to speak Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          After having received my Bachelor's of Arts in Political Science, I decided to become
          a school teacher which I did in both France where I taught English and here at a private high school, where
          I taught history and French. After a few years I began to realize teaching didn't provide the challenge
          that I was looking for. I loved learning languages and was always very good with computers
          and so I found coding, a perfect fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then enrolled in Orange County Code School where I learned how to program web
          applications and graduated in August of 2017. I am now capable of developing full stack applications,
          and have done so on many occasions as can be seen on my many personal projects.
        </p>

          I am currently looking for a full time position as a developer and am best reached through
