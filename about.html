        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Gerard Degas and I am a web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up learning both French and English as my first languages in elementary school in Fountain Valley, CA. I started to think in other languages
          at a very young age. Since then I developed a love for learning languages as well as teaching them and have always been good at picking them up.
        </p>
        <p>
          After having received my degree in poli-sci at UC Riverside, I decided to become
          a school teacher. I taught English in Bordeaux, France for a little while and then moved back to the US to teach private high school languages, where
          I taught social sciences and French, but something was missing. After a few years I started to feel something lacked in my career in teaching, I wasn't being challenged the way I wanted to be. I knew I loved learning languages and was always adept working with computers
          and so I found coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enrolled in Orange County Code School where I learned how to program web
          applications and graduated in August of 2017. I now love my work as a full stack engineer at Uber, building awesome web applications every day.
